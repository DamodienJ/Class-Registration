# Student Registration System (C++)

A console-based student registration system developed as a collaborative Data Structures project.  
The program simulates student enrollment and schedule management using core data structures and file I/O.

## Features
- Student lookup using **recursive binary search**
- Students stored in a **dynamic array**
- Course schedules implemented with **linked lists**
- Add and drop courses via a **menu-driven interface**
- Loads data from text files using **file I/O**

## Technologies & Concepts
- C++
- Dynamic memory management (pointers)
- Linked lists
- Recursive binary search
- File input/output

## Input Files
This program reads from the following files:
- `Students.txt`
- `courses.txt`

These files must be located in the same directory as the executable.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `Registration.sln` in Visual Studio
3. Build and run the project

## Notes
- This project was completed as a group assignment
- Focused on reinforcing core data structures and recursion
